\begin{itemize}
	\item <1-> \textbf{Presentation of HW/SW Design Methodology:} It is introduced a hardware/software design methodology for low-power floating-point neural network acceleration for embedded systems (open source)
	
	\item<2-> \textbf{Advancements in Low-Precision Floating-Point Techniques:} The results demonstrated that these techniques significantly increase processing speed and reduce both hardware area and energy consumption while preserving quality-or-result and platform compatibility
	
	\item<3-> \textbf{Handling Iterative Optimization:} It is demonstrated that low-precision floating-point techniques can effectively manage iterative optimization processes with non-negativity constraints, with minimal impact on accuracy, proving their viability for on-device learning
	
	\item<4-> \textbf{Application in TinyML:} It was showcased that these techniques successfully handle regression problems with quality preservation
