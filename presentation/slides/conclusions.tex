	\begin{itemize} % The <+-> will make the items appear one-by-one
		\item \textbf{HW/SW Design Methodology for Low-Power Neural Network Acceleration with Hybrid Custom Floating-Point Arithmetic}
		\begin{itemize}
			\item<2-> Mimic standard floating-point acceleration in extreme edge devices
			\item<3-> Smallest CNN floating-point accelerator in the literature
			\item<4-> On-device iterative optimization with non-negativity constraints using 4-bit weights
		\end{itemize}
		\item \textbf{Technological Transformation}
		\begin{itemize}
			\item<5-> Inference was the beginning in TinyML. Low-precision floating-point is opening the door for a new generation of on-device training accelerators that are essential in the next phase of AI evolution.
